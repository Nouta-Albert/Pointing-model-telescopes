  This repository contains the Python scripts developed as part of my Masterâ€™s thesis project titled
  "Automatic Pointing Model for Euler" at the University of Geneva. It includes tools for pointing offset
  analysis, model construction, TPOINT-style emulation in Python and diagnostics for telescope calibration.
  These scripts were applied to the Euler Telescope at La Silla and are provided to support reproducibility
  and future development.
